TODO:

  * POLARITIES:
    * JB: page 5: I found the algorithm in Figure 1 and the explanations on page 5 -
      especially the handling of polarities - difficult to understand. Giving an
      example in which also the polarities are handled might help increase
      clarity.

  * QUICKCHECK ETC.:
    * JB: The other problem is that I get the impression that the same task could be
      accomplished using a tool such as quickcheck, if this is really just
      testing whether a quantifier-free first-order formula involving recursive
      functions is refutable.
    * JB: On page 15 a contrast is made between "total recursive functions" as
      compared with under specification and non-executable functions, but it's
      not easy for the reader to see that the proposed method copes with ease
      (because the notion of "admissible" is rather opaque).

  * ADMISSIBILITY:
    * JB: The closed-ness under function definition is a very strong property, if
      finite formulas are considered. For instance given the equation f(x) =
      f(x-1) and the term f(n), one need to entail the equation f(n)=f(n-1),
      f(n-1)=f(n-2) etc. thus no finite closed formula exists.

    * JB: page 4: it might be good to also formulate the result about the
      admissibility of productive co-recursive function definitions in the form
      of a theorem.

    * JB: The notion of a well-founded definition is not very clear and should be
      clarified. In order to deal with definitions such as f(x) = f(x-1), the
      well-founded relation must be defined over interpreted terms (e.g., x >
      x-1 modulo arithmetic), which means that the well-founded order must be
      defined with respect to the set of interpretations of the considered
      theory (this does not seem completely straightforward to me and deserves
      formal treatment).

  * AJR: ``whose \Sigma_1-reduct is a model of T1'': what about \Sigma_2-reduct ?

  * AJR: The definition of ``uninterpreted symbols'' should be relative to a
    specific theory.

  * AJR: Definition 1. Is the formula \Psi allowed to contain quantifiers? (this
    seems to be intended in Fig. 1).

  * AJR: Just after Definition 1, it should be mentioned that f_i is in
    \Sigma^{dfn}.

  * AJR: Definition 2. What if f_i(t) contains a variable that is universally or
    existentially quantified in \Psi? (or is \Psi quantifier-free?). When I
    first read the paper I though that \Psi was intended to be quantifier-free
    but Fig. 1 contains rules for quantification, which puzzled me. If \Psi is
    allowed to contain quantifier then I think that Definition 2 should be
    rewritten. A quantification should probably be added to the formulas
    \phi_i in the set).

  * AJR: Also Definition 2 can probably be relaxed in order to take into account
    the context in which the term t occurs (this is essential if quantifiers
    are allowed).

  * AJR: It might be good to add an intuitive explanation after Definition 2, 
    in which you explain that \psi is closed under function expansion 
    wrt \Delta if it already constrains the functions defined in \Delta 
    as much as necessary such that in every model {\cal I}  of \psi
    the values for the terms f(t) occurring in \psi computed according 
    to the definitions in \Delta agree with the values of these terms in I. 

  * AJR: Mention that the "formula" can actually be infinite (it would be better
    to use infinite sets of formulas), because this is used in the proof of
    Theorem 7 (\bigcup L_{\infy}).
    
  * AJR: The remark on the completeness of the quantifier-elimination method in
    [19] is slightly misleading to my opinion. Indeed, because the underlying
    logic is not compact, the completeness of instantiation does not imply
    completeness of the calculus (since the set of relevant instances is
    unsatisfiable, but usually admits no unsatisfiable finite subset). I think
    a remark should be added to clarify this point (or just avoid referring to
    "completeness").

  * AJR: page 3: line 9: You use the index f to \forall only to mark the definition
    of f?

  * AJR: Definition 1: Do you impose any restrictions on the formula \psi occurring
    in a formula \phi in definitional form? Should \psi be a ground formula or
    can it contain quantifiers?

  * AJR (double-check): Section 3, lines 3-4:  You mention the T-satisfiability
    of \phi'. Instead, the extension T' of T with "free" functions in E(\Sigma)
    should be considered (and satisfiability of \phi' wrt T' ).

  * AJR: page 7: - Lemma 5: Does the set L of ground literals depend on the
    interpretation I or not?


MAYBE:

  * AJR/JR: It would be useful to give already on p. 3 examples of formulae which
    are/are not closed under function expansion.

  * JB: I was already lost by Definition 2, buried in formal definitions.

  * AJR: page 8: - How do you know how many times you should unfold the definition
    in the case of s(c)? How is this implemented in CVC4?


IGNORE:

  * Definition 2: The notation {\cal T}(\psi) was not introduced before.


KIND OF DONE:

  * JB: It is not clear to me in which way the models obtained with the method in
    the paper can be used (they are in general not models for the original
    formula \phi, but can be seen as a kind of "partial models" of \phi).


DONE:

  * JB: Theorem 7: You mention that \phi and A(\phi) are T-equisatisfiable; Please
    clarify the terminology (the signature of the formula A(\phi) includes the
    functions in E(\Sigma)).

  * JB: When I read that a formula is "trivially closed under function expansion"
    my reaction is "trivial to you perhaps, but unknowable to me".

  * AJR: line 5 from the bottom: Why do you call the function p "uninterpreted"? 
    The definition you give provides an "interpretation" for it.
      >> Just drop "uninterpreted"

  * SC/JB: Add missing elements to pipeline
